merge of github.com/jdonaldson/vaxe and  github.com/MarcWeber/vim-haxe as
discussed on the mailinglist.

feature list:
  - haxe based completion
  - ctags based completion - because it makes writing some code shorter.
    using haxe -v or such the way you told me.
    (Yes, the ctags based completion is also a compromise only - but works
    for 90% of cases)
  - configuration based on .hxml files. This should support many targets
    using --next.
  - running ctags (on std core library and on -lib libraries installed by
    haxelib ?)
  - adding ctags to &ctags var so that tags are found
  - sane defaults for
    * syntax
    * indentation
    * commenting
    * matchit                                              
  - eventually some features taking actions based on compiler messages
    such as adding imports (experimental)

  optional:
    * snipmate
    * vim-addon-actions
    * status line/tagbar (http://majutsushi.github.com/tagbar/)


TODO: 
vim-haxe is much more descriptive than "vaxe". Its better for google and humans IMHO.
